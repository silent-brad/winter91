		<h2>What is Winter 100?</h2>
		<p>
			Winter 100 is a fitness challenge designed to help you stay active during the winter months. 
			The goal is simple: walk or run 100 miles between the start of winter and the end of the challenge period.
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			"Above all, do not lose your desire to walk. Everyday, I walk myself into a state of well-being 
			and walk away from every illness. I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no 
			thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it."
			<footer>— Søren Kierkegaard</footer>

		<h2>Why Winter?</h2>
		<p>
			Winter is often the most challenging time to stay active. The days are shorter, 
			the weather is harsh, and motivation can be hard to find. Winter 100 provides 
			structure, accountability, and community to help you not just survive winter, 
			but thrive through it.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			By the end of the challenge, you'll have built lasting habits, improved your 
			fitness, and proven to yourself that you can stay committed even when things get tough.
